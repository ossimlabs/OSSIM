   /**
   * Thread is an abstract class.  It provides a 
   * general purpose thread interface that handles preliminary setup
   * of the std c++11 thread.  It allows one to derive
   * from Thread and override the run method.  Your thread should have calls
   * to interrupt() whenever your thread is in a location that is
   * interruptable.  If cancel is called then any thread that is interruptable will 
   * throw an Interrupt and be caught in the base Thread class and then exit 
   * the thread.
   *
   * Example:
   * @code
   * #include <ossim/base/Thread.h>
   * #include <ossim/base/Barrier.h>
   * class TestThread : public ossim::Thread
   *  {
   *  public:
   *      TestThread():ossim::Thread(){}
   *      ~TestThread(){
   *         waitForCompletion();
   *      }
   *
   *   protected:
   *      virtual void run()
   *      {
   *         barrierStart.block();
   *         for(int x =0 ; x < 10;++x){
   *            std::cout << "THREAD: " << getCurrentThreadId() << "\n";
   *            // simulate 10 milliseconds of uninterruptable work
   *            sleepInMilliSeconds(10);
   *            interrupt();
   *         }
   *         barrierFinished.block();
   *      }
   *   };
   * int main(int agrc, char* argv[])
   * {
   *    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TestThread> > threads(nThreads);
   *    for(auto& thread:threads)
   *    {
   *      thread = std::make_shared<TestThread>();
   *      thread->start();
   *    }
   *
   *    // now let's wait for each thread to finish 
   *    // before exiting
   *    for(auto& thread:threads)
   *    {
   *      thread->waitForCompletion();
   *    }
