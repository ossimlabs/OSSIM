# Find the native AWS(Amazon Web Services) cpp sdk includes and libraries.
#
# This module defines:
#
# AWS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find Aws.h and S3Client.h.
# AWS_LIBRARIES, libraries to link against to use AWS.  Currently there are
# two looked for, aws-cpp-sdk-core and aws-cpp-sdk-s3 libraries.
# AWS_FOUND, True if found, false if one of the above are not found.
# 
# For ossim, typically geos will be system installed which should be found; 
# or found in the ossim 3rd party dependencies directory from a geos build 
# and install.  If the latter it will rely on CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and 
# CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH having the path to the party dependencies directory.
# 
# NOTE: 
# This script is specialized for ossim.
